#first
support for multiple lists -> dont have to be just todos.
ex: add "" to personal item list
tools: get all lists
        get a list data
        CRUD data to some list
        #have a master list incase no list is provided

add optional datetime to tasks:
while adding a item it would take time as optional


reschedule tasks:
find the task
update the time of the task, one function to update any task -> ONE FUNCTION EACH FOR CRUD?


check if task exists already before creating a new
search for the task -> by getting all tasks ? or SIMILARITY SEARCH OR how? VECTOR DB?
if already there, update with new info

SCHEMA:
ID, ITEM, LIST NAME, TIME 


#SECOND
remind each task for the day at the time asked -> scheuler for tasks with datetime
remind lists, tasks already created either periodically or once at a fixed time
remind daily list at a fixed time in the morning

Ai asks about status of task after each and If some task was not 
completed  and asks when to reshedule.
if not reply, asks what happened, do you want to change the schedule -> only thrice spread out through the day 
on completing tasks, if task was productive like not just lunch or chilling, gives motivating praise



#THIRD
AI plans goals, with various tasks spread out over a time
AI plans day. 
AI learns preferences over time and schedules day acc to that. Like comes at different time 
form office each day (some tasks duration changes), when sleep? when lunch, dinner? after how mcuh time is break needed, what chilling activities?
